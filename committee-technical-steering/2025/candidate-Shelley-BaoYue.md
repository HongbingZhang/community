## What I have done

I joined the KubeEdge community in 2022 and have been involved in various aspects such as feature development, release management, and community governance.

- I contributed to the development of features like `new release of edged`, `static pod`, `Windows node support`, `regular Kubernetes upgrades`, and `conformance testing`. I also organized the establishment of SIG Node/Testing, maintaining a position among the top three contributors in the community for three consecutive years.

- I organized the community release management work and established SIG Release starting from KubeEdge release 1.14, overseeing community feature planning, releases, and promotional activities for release documentation.

- I became one of KubeEdge maintainer, participating in governance and operations. I redesigned the official website, introducing pages for case studies and partners. Since 2022, I have participated in multiple KubeCon events in Europe, China, and Japan, engaging in discussions and sharing on topics related to the Android ecosystem, large-scale support, and AI.

## What I'll do

Serving in KubeEdge Committee Technical Steering, I hope to organize more developer-focused activities in the future to attract more cloud-native enthusiasts to participate in community development and help developers find a sense of belonging within the community. Additionally, I would like to see more collaboration and exchange activities with partners from various fields, including AI and robotics, to explore the value of KubeEdge in more domains while also understanding the expectations of community partners for the project.
