# Open Source Promotion Plan - Summer 2020

## Background

This is a program hosted by ISCAS(Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences) and openEuler community. It is very similar with Google Summer of Code, the only difference is that it is only targeted for Chinese students.

This year(2020) is their first time to host this event.

## Brief introduction of KubeEdge

KubeEdge is built upon Kubernetes and extends native containerized application orchestration and device management to hosts at the Edge. It consists of cloud part and edge part, provides core infrastructure support for networking, application deployment and metadata synchronization between cloud and edge. It also supports MQTT which enables edge devices to access through edge nodes.
With KubeEdge it is easy to get and deploy existing complicated machine learning, image recognition, event processing and other high level applications to the Edge. With business logic running at the Edge, much larger volumes of data can be secured & processed locally where the data is produced. With data processed at the Edge, the responsiveness is increased dramatically and data privacy is protected.
