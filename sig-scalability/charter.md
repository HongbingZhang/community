# SIG Scalability Charter

This charter adheres to the conventions described in [KubeEdge Open Governance](https://github.com/kubeedge/community/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md) and uses the Roles and Organization Management outlined in the governance doc.

## Scope

SIG Scalability's primary responsibilities are to define and drive scalability goals for KubeEdge. This involves defining, testing and measuring performance and scalability related Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and ensuring that every KubeEdge release meets Service Level Objectives (SLOs) built on top of those SLIs.

We also coordinate and contribute to general system-wide scalability and performance improvements (that don't fall into the charter of another individual SIG) by driving significant architectural changes and finding bottlenecks, as well as providing consultations about any scalability and performance related aspects of KubeEdge.

### In scope

#### Code, Binaries and Services:

- Scalability and performance testing frameworks. such as Edgemark

-  Scalability and performance tests jobs

####  Cross-cutting and Externally Facing Processes

- Defining what does “KubeEdge scales” mean by defining (or approving) individual performance SLIs/SLOs, ensuring they are all oriented on user experience and consistent with each other.
- Ensuring that each official KubeEdge release satisfies all scalability and performance related requirements.
- Establishing and documenting best practises on how to design and/or implement KubeEdge features in scalable and performant way. Educating contributors and consulting individual designs/implementations to ensure that those are widely used. 
- Finding system bottlenecks and coordinating improvement on cross-cutting architectural changes.

### Out of scope
- Improving performance/scalability of features falling into charters of individual SIGs.

## Roles and Organization Management

This SIG follows and adheres to the Roles and Organization Management outlined in KubeEdge Open Governance and opts-in to updates and modifications to KubeEdge Open Governance.

### Additional responsibilities of Chairs

- Manage and curate the project boards associated with all sub-projects ahead of every SIG meeting so they may be discussed
- Ensure the agenda is populated 24 hours in advance of the meeting, or the meeting is then cancelled
- Report the SIG status at events and community meetings wherever possible
- Actively promote diversity and inclusion in the SIG
- Uphold the KubeEdge Code of Conduct especially in terms of personal behavior and responsibility
