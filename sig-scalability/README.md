# Scalability Special Interest Group

SIG Scalability is responsible for defining and driving scalability goals for KubeEdge. We also coordinate and contribute to general system-wide scalability and performance improvements (not falling into the charter of other individual SIGs) by driving significant architectural changes and finding bottlenecks, as well as providing guidance and consultations about any scalability and performance related aspects of Kubernetes. We are actively working on finding and removing various scalability bottlenecks which will lead us towards pushing the entire system's scalability higher.

The [charter](https://github.com/kubeedge/community/blob/master/sig-scalability/charter.md) defines the scope and governance of the Scalability Special Interest Group.
